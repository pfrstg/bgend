# bgend: Backgammon End Game Strategy

This repository contains code for calculating optimal backgammon play
at the final race.

This is the same type of functionality as in gnubg
(https://www.gnu.org/software/gnubg/) in the makebearoff
databases. This is a python implementation which is quite a bit
simpler, though it lacks some functionality from that program.

This is not an officially supported Google product.
